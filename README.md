# Self Organizing Maps implemented in JAX
Self-Organizing Maps implementation in JAX and Ninjax base on [MiniSom](https://github.com/JustGlowing/minisom).

Self Organizing Maps
--------------------

SOM-in-JAX is a reimplementation of minimalistic and Numpy based implementation of the Self Organizing Maps (SOM). SOM is a type of Artificial Neural Network able to convert complex, nonlinear statistical relationships between high-dimensional data items into simple geometric relationships on a low-dimensional display. SOM-in-JAX allows researchers to easily build on top of it in JAX and to give students the ability to quickly grasp its details.
